Week 5 Homework
Observations
1. The Sex distiribution was virtually even, 125 male mice and 123 female mice.
2. All drug regimens were not used the same amount of times. Although some had the same amount of times used, this number was not consistent and I believe it should have been. Could have made the data more reliable.
3. Out of the 4 drugs used for the boxplot, only 1 had potential outliers (Infubinol).
